# Sewerage Project Evaluation

The **socioeconomic evaluation** of a sewerage project involves **identifying, quantifying, and valuing** all associated costs and benefits for scenarios **with and without** the project. The primary social goal is to **reduce societal costs** related to wastewater disposal.  

## **Methodological Approach**  
Traditionally, a **cost-efficiency methodology** has been used due to the difficulty of valuing some benefits. This approach assumes that:  
1. The project is profitable.  
2. All technical alternatives provide the same benefits, so the one with the **lowest cost** is chosen (using the **equivalent annual cost** criterion).  

### **Social Benefits of Sewerage Projects**  
a) **Improved Housing Conditions:**  
   - Reduces flooding and unpleasant conditions near homes.  
   - Enhances property appearance and accessibility.  

b) **Lower Costs for Alternative Systems:**  
   - Eliminates the need for septic tanks, latrines, and other costly private disposal methods.  
   - Reduces maintenance expenses.  

c) **Less Groundwater Contamination:**  
   - Prevents wastewater from infiltrating underground water sources.  
   - Considered an **intangible benefit** due to measurement challenges.  

d) **Increased Potable Water Consumption:**  
   - With efficient wastewater disposal, households use more potable water, leading to a social benefit.

### **Quantification and Valuation of Social Benefits in Sewerage Projects**  

The benefits of a sewerage project can be **quantified and valued** through the following key aspects:  

a) **Improved Image of the Area**
   - The benefit is measured by the **increase in land value** due to improved environmental conditions.  
   - A better wastewater system reduces flooding and odors, making properties more attractive and valuable.  

b) **Cost Savings from Eliminating Alternative Evacuation Systems**  
   - In the absence of a sewer system, residents must build and maintain **septic tanks, latrines, and wells** for wastewater disposal.  
   - The introduction of a sewer system eliminates these costs.  

c) **Increased Potable Water Consumption**  
   - With an efficient wastewater system, the **cost of water disposal decreases**, encouraging higher potable water consumption.  
   - The benefit is measured by the **additional water consumption** and the **social value** it generates.  
   - However, the cost of producing and expanding the potable water system must be deducted from this benefit.

### **Identification of Social Costs in Sewerage Projects**  

The **social costs** of implementing a sewerage system arise throughout the project's lifespan and are classified into:  

a) **Investment Costs:**  
   - Expenses for **constructing the sewer system**.  
   - Costs incurred by **users for connecting** their homes to the system.  

b) **Maintenance Costs:**  
   - Costs of **materials and resources** needed to ensure the proper functioning of the system.

### **Quantification, Valuation of Social Costs, and Project Profitability**  

a) **Quantification and Valuation of Social Costs**  
   - **Investment and maintenance costs** are estimated based on:  
      - **Labor hours (man-hours)**  
      - **Material requirements**  
   - To assess their **social value**, private (market) costs are adjusted using **social adjustment factors**.  

b) **Profitability Indicators**  
   - The **Social Net Present Value (NPV)** is calculated to determine if the project is beneficial over its lifespan.  
   - This metric compares **total social costs and benefits**.  

c) **Case Study: Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo**  
   - The **Luis Donaldo Colosio (LDC) neighborhood** (25,281 residents) lacks a **potable water and sewer system**.  
   - Residents rely on **public hydrants, water trucks, and septic systems**, causing significant inconvenience.  
   - The **state government** proposes installing potable water and sewerage systems, requiring a **$49.3 million investment**.  
   - Since the **potable water project is already socially profitable**, the evaluation focuses only on the **additional costs and benefits of the sewerage system**.

## Example
### **Social Benefits, Costs, and Profitability of the Sewerage Project in Playa del Carmen**  

a) **Identification, Quantification, and Valuation of Social Benefits**  

- **Increased Water Consumption**:  
  - Without the project, residents consume **88.33 liters per day (lhd)**.  
  - With the project, consumption increases to **108 lhd** due to improved sanitation.  
  - The additional **19.67 lhd** generates a social benefit valued at **$218,896/year**.  
  - Over a 20-year period, this benefit has a present value of **$1.3 million**.  

- **Elimination of Sanitation-Related Discomfort**:  
  - Without the project, residents face **$983,099/year** in discomfort costs.  
  - With the project, these costs are eliminated, creating an equivalent benefit.  

- **Savings from Replacing Current Evacuation Systems**:  
  - Maintenance of **21,994 septic pits** every five years costs **$8.79 million**.  
  - Annual replacement of **3,286 latrines** costs **$657,200/year**.  
  - These costs are avoided with the project.  

- **Total Present Value of Benefits**: **$18.9 million**.  

b) **Identification, Quantification, and Valuation of Costs**  

- **Investment Costs**:  
  - Installing the sewer system in **Luis Donaldo Colosio (LDC) neighborhood** costs **$28.29 million**.  

- **Operation and Maintenance Costs**:  
  - Includes maintenance and additional water supply costs.  
  - Total cost: **$524,428/year**, with a present value of **$3.13 million**.  

c) **Profitability Indicators**  

- **Net Present Value (NPV)** calculation:  
  - **Total benefits**: **$18.9 million**.  
  - **Total costs**: **$31.42 million**.  
  - **Net Value**: **-$12.49 million** (negative).  

**Conclusion**  

The **social costs exceed the benefits**, meaning the project is **not financially viable** from a social perspective. It is recommended to **explore lower-cost alternatives**.
